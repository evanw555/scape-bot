Data we collect
---------------
1. ScapeBot collects data such as Guild ID (i.e. Server ID), Channel ID, and RSN (i.e. RuneScape Name, or OSRS username).
2. ScapeBot does _not_ collect any personal information or data.
3. ScapeBot will _not_ store or redistribute any message sent in any server.

### Why are we collecting such information?
We collect such information to provide unique behavior to different servers. Some features work differently for each server, thus requiring us to collect unique identifiers such as ID of the server where the bot was added.
We collect RSNs that are provided to ScapeBot by the users in order for the bot to maintain a list of OSRS users to track via Jagex's public Hi-Scores API.

### How do we protect our client's data?
We ensure that all collected data is safe and secure in our database, and we will never misuse or share this data.

### How can you get your server's data wiped from our database?
By removing ScapeBot from your server, your server's Guild ID and all data associated with it will be wiped from our database.

### Can you prevent your RSN from being tracked?
No, as your RSN and the in-game information associated with it (e.g. total XP, boss kills) are already public information as exposed by Jagex's public Hi-Scores API.
Furthermore, there is no way for the maintainers of ScapeBot to verify that you own a particular RSN, and blocking RSNs without proper verification could lead to abuse of other users and servers.
